# Conversation Context Preservation for SMS Reconnections

## Overview
Enhanced SMS conversation reconnection to preserve full context when WebSocket connections close and restart, ensuring seamless customer experience across conversation sessions.

## Problem Solved
When SMS conversations timeout after 1 minute (to save ElevenLabs credits) and customers send new messages, the system needs to:
1. Load complete conversation history from Supabase
2. Include ElevenLabs summaries from previous voice calls
3. Provide rich context to agents about previous interactions
4. Ensure agents don't restart conversations or lose context

## Enhanced Implementation

### 1. Rich Summary Logic for SMS Reconnections
```javascript
// Uses same logic as voice call initiation
let previousSummary;
if (summaryData?.summary && summaryData.summary.length > 20) {
  // Use actual ElevenLabs summary (comprehensive voice+SMS analysis)
  previousSummary = summaryData.summary.length > 500 ? 
    summaryData.summary.substring(0, 500) + "..." : summaryData.summary;
} else if (history.length > 0) {
  // Build rich summary from recent messages
  const recentMessages = history.slice(-6);
  previousSummary = `Previous conversation: ${recentMessages.length} messages exchanged across voice/SMS. `;
  // Include last customer message for immediate context
} else {
  previousSummary = "First conversation - no previous interaction history";
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Dynamic Variables
```javascript
dynamic_variables: {
  customer_name: customerName,
  lead_status: leadStatus, 
  previous_summary: previousSummary,
  // NEW: Additional context overview
  conversation_overview: conversationContext.substring(0, 300) + "..."
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Context Metadata
```javascript
context_metadata: {
  total_messages: history.length,
  has_elevenlabs_summary: !!(summaryData?.summary && summaryData.summary.length > 20),
  voice_messages: history.filter(m => m.type === 'voice').length,
  sms_messages: history.filter(m => m.type === 'text').length,
  last_interaction: history[history.length - 1]?.timestamp
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Agent Instructions
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- FIRST: Read the CONVERSATION SUMMARY above - contains essential customer details
- If summary mentions specific vehicle models, budgets, or details, DO NOT ask again
- This conversation may be RESUMING after a brief timeout - continue naturally
- Reference specific details from recent messages to show continuity
- If this feels like a continuation, acknowledge it naturally
- DO NOT restart or re-introduce yourself if you've already spoken with this customer
```

## Flow Diagram

```
1. Customer sends SMS
   â†“
2. Check for existing WebSocket (likely closed due to timeout)
   â†“
3. Start new conversation with startConversationWithTimeout()
   â†“
4. Load complete conversation history from Supabase
   â”œâ”€â”€ Voice messages from previous calls
   â”œâ”€â”€ SMS messages from previous sessions  
   â””â”€â”€ ElevenLabs summaries from post-call webhooks
   â†“
5. Build rich conversation context
   â”œâ”€â”€ Include ElevenLabs summary if available
   â”œâ”€â”€ Include last 3 voice + 3 SMS messages
   â””â”€â”€ Build rich fallback summary if no ElevenLabs summary
   â†“
6. Send to ElevenLabs agent with comprehensive context
   â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_context (detailed history)
   â”œâ”€â”€ previous_summary (ElevenLabs analysis or rich fallback)
   â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_overview (truncated context)
   â””â”€â”€ context_metadata (statistics)
   â†“
7. Agent responds with full context awareness
```

## Benefits

- Customers don't experience conversation restarts
- Agents remember all previous interactions
- No loss of context when WebSocket timeouts occur

### ðŸ§  **Rich Context Preservation**
- ElevenLabs summaries include cross-channel analysis
- Recent messages from all channels (voice + SMS)
- Customer sentiment and preferences maintained

### ðŸ’° **Cost-Effective Timeouts**
- 1-minute SMS timeouts save ElevenLabs credits
- Full context restoration ensures no customer experience degradation
- Smart reconnection with complete history

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Agent Briefing**
- Agent knows exactly what was discussed previously
- Specific vehicle models, budgets, and preferences remembered
- Conversation stage and next steps preserved

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Voice Call â†’ SMS Later
```
1. Customer has voice call about Mazda CX-5, $400/month budget
2. ElevenLabs creates summary: "Customer interested in Mazda CX-5..."
3. 2 hours later, customer sends SMS: "Still thinking about that car"
4. Agent gets full context: "Great to hear from you again! Still considering the Mazda CX-5 we discussed?"
```

### Scenario 2: SMS Session Timeout â†’ Resume
```
1. Customer starts SMS conversation about vehicle preferences
2. WebSocket closes after 1-minute timeout (saving credits)
3. Customer responds 5 minutes later
4. New WebSocket starts with full conversation history
5. Agent continues naturally: "As we were discussing your SUV preferences..."
```

## Monitoring

Watch for these log indicators:
```
ðŸ“‹ SMS using actual ElevenLabs summary (623 chars): Customer interested in Mazda CX-5...
ðŸ“‹ SMS Context preserved: 7 total messages, using ElevenLabs summary: true
âœ… SMS conversation reconnected with full context
```

## Result

Customers experience seamless conversations even when technical timeouts occur, with agents maintaining complete context and conversation continuity across all channels and sessions.
