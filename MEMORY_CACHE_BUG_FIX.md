# Memory Cache Persistence Bug Fix

## The Problem üêõ

**User deleted lead from Supabase but agent still had Mercedes conversation data**

```
‚úÖ Supabase: Failed to retrieve conversation summary: { code: 'PGRST116', details: 'The result contains 0 rows' }
‚ùå Agent: üìã Using actual ElevenLabs summary (190 chars): DD expressed interest in financing a Mercedes EQE with a $2,000/month budget...
```

**Result**: Agent ignored BMW conversation and responded about deleted Mercedes data.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug Flow
1. **User deletes lead** via dashboard
2. **Individual lead deletion endpoint** runs:
   - ‚úÖ Deletes from Supabase (works correctly)
   - ‚úÖ Removes from `dynamicLeads` Map  
   - ‚úÖ Removes from `phoneToLeadMapping` Map
   - ‚ùå **MISSING**: Does NOT clear `conversationSummaries` Map
   - ‚ùå **MISSING**: Does NOT clear `conversationContexts` Map

3. **Later, agent conversation** starts:
   - ‚úÖ Tries Supabase first ‚Üí returns empty (correct)
   - ‚ùå Falls back to in-memory cache ‚Üí returns stale Mercedes data
   - ‚ùå Agent uses old context instead of fresh conversation

### Code Comparison

#### ‚ùå Individual Lead Delete (Was Broken)
```javascript
// Delete from in-memory storage
if (dynamicLeads.has(leadId)) {
  dynamicLeads.delete(leadId);
}

// Remove from phone mappings
const phoneToRemove = Array.from(phoneToLeadMapping.entries())
  .find(([phone, storedLeadId]) => storedLeadId === leadId)?.[0];

if (phoneToRemove) {
  phoneToLeadMapping.delete(phoneToRemove);
  // ‚ùå MISSING: No conversation cache clearing!
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Delete All Leads (Was Working)
```javascript
// Clear in-memory storage
dynamicLeads.clear();

// Clear phone mappings
phoneToLeadMapping.clear();

// Clear conversation contexts
conversationContexts.clear();
conversationSummaries.clear();        // ‚úÖ This was missing from individual delete!
```

## The Fix Applied üîß

### Added Missing Cache Clearing
```javascript
if (phoneToRemove) {
  phoneToLeadMapping.delete(phoneToRemove);
  console.log('‚úÖ Removed phone mapping for lead:', leadId);
  
  // CRITICAL FIX: Clear conversation caches for this phone number
  // This prevents stale conversation summaries (like Mercedes data) from being retrieved
  const normalizedPhone = normalizePhoneNumber(phoneToRemove);
  
  if (conversationContexts.has(normalizedPhone)) {
    conversationContexts.delete(normalizedPhone);
    console.log('‚úÖ Cleared conversation context cache for:', normalizedPhone);
  }
  
  if (conversationSummaries.has(normalizedPhone)) {
    conversationSummaries.delete(normalizedPhone);
    console.log('‚úÖ Cleared conversation summary cache for:', normalizedPhone);
  }
  
  // Also close any active WebSocket connections for this phone
  if (activeConversations.has(normalizedPhone)) {
    const ws = activeConversations.get(normalizedPhone);
    ws.close();
    activeConversations.delete(normalizedPhone);
    console.log('‚úÖ Closed active WebSocket connection for:', normalizedPhone);
  }
}
```

## Why This Happened

1. **Delete All** endpoint was implemented with complete cleanup (worked correctly)
2. **Individual Delete** endpoint was implemented without conversation cache cleanup (bug)
3. **Fallback logic** in `getConversationSummary()` meant stale cache was used when Supabase was empty
4. **System design** prioritizes cache performance but this created data persistence after deletion

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
1. User deletes lead ‚Üí Supabase cleaned ‚úÖ
2. Agent starts conversation ‚Üí Supabase empty ‚úÖ 
3. System falls back to cache ‚Üí Returns stale Mercedes data ‚ùå
4. Agent: "Let's continue with Mercedes EQE financing..." ‚ùå
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ  
```
1. User deletes lead ‚Üí Supabase cleaned ‚úÖ
2. Conversation caches cleared ‚Üí No stale data ‚úÖ
3. Agent starts conversation ‚Üí No previous context ‚úÖ
4. Agent: "Hi! What can I help you with today?" ‚úÖ
```

## Testing Verification

### Test Steps
1. **Create lead** with conversation history about Mercedes
2. **Make voice call** to verify Mercedes context works  
3. **Delete lead** via dashboard
4. **Send new SMS** about BMW
5. **Verify agent** responds to BMW, not Mercedes

### Expected Logs After Fix
```
üóëÔ∏è Deleting lead: sl_1751324926194_lsj2veafz
‚úÖ Lead deleted from database: sl_1751324926194_lsj2veafz
‚úÖ Lead deleted from memory: sl_1751324926194_lsj2veafz
‚úÖ Removed phone mapping for lead: sl_1751324926194_lsj2veafz

‚úÖ Cleared conversation summary cache for: +16049085474
‚úÖ Closed active WebSocket connection for: +16049085474
```

## Files Modified

- `server.js` (lines ~2560-2583): Added conversation cache clearing to individual lead deletion endpoint

## Technical Impact

- **‚úÖ Data consistency**: No more stale conversation data after lead deletion
- **‚úÖ Agent accuracy**: Agents respond to current conversation, not deleted history  
- **‚úÖ Performance maintained**: Only clears cache for specific phone number, not entire cache
- **‚úÖ Backward compatible**: No changes to existing API contracts

## Related Systems

This fix ensures consistency across:
- **Supabase persistence** (conversations, summaries, call sessions)
- **In-memory caches** (conversationContexts, conversationSummaries)
- **WebSocket connections** (active SMS conversations)
- **Phone mappings** (phoneToLeadMapping)
- **ElevenLabs integration** (context variables and dynamic summaries)

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. **Standardize deletion patterns** - use same cleanup logic everywhere
2. **Cache invalidation testing** - verify cache clearing in all delete operations  
3. **Data consistency checks** - ensure memory and database stay in sync
4. **Automated tests** - test deletion scenarios across all endpoints
