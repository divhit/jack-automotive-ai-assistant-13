# First Message Strategy - How It Works for All Scenarios

## üéØ **The Challenge**

You're absolutely right! If someone has been chatting with Jack via SMS and then Jack makes an outbound call, we need the first message to acknowledge this is a continuation, not a cold call.

**The Problem:**
- Cold call: "Hi John! Jack from Premium Auto here. I'm an AI assistant specializing in vehicle financing..." ‚úÖ
- SMS continuation: "Hi John! Jack from Premium Auto here. I'm an AI assistant specializing in vehicle financing..." ‚ùå (sounds like Jack forgot they were texting)

## üîß **The Solution**

Since ElevenLabs doesn't support conditionals in the first message, we use a **two-step approach**:

### **Step 1: Neutral First Message**
```
Hi {{customer_name}}! Jack from {{organization_name}} here. I'm here to help you with your vehicle financing. Are you available to chat for a few minutes?
```

This works for both scenarios:
- **New customers:** Sounds like a professional introduction
- **Existing customers:** Sounds like a natural continuation

### **Step 2: System Prompt Handles Context**
The system prompt has access to all variables and instructs Jack to immediately acknowledge the context in his first substantive response.

## üé¨ **How It Works in Practice**

### **Scenario 1: New Customer (Cold Call)**
**First message:** "Hi Sarah! Jack from Downtown Motors here. I'm here to help you with your vehicle financing. Are you available to chat for a few minutes?"

**Customer:** "Um, who is this?"

**Jack's response:** "Hi Sarah! I'm Jack, an AI assistant from Downtown Motors. I'm reaching out because you expressed interest in vehicle financing. I specialize in helping folks secure automotive financing even with challenging credit situations. Is this a good time to chat about your vehicle needs?"

### **Scenario 2: SMS Continuation**
**First message:** "Hi John! Jack from Premium Auto here. I'm here to help you with your vehicle financing. Are you available to chat for a few minutes?"

**Customer:** "Oh hi Jack! Yeah, I can talk."

**Jack's response:** "Great! I see we were just discussing your interest in that Honda Civic and your $400/month budget. I wanted to call you directly to speed up the process and go over some financing options that might work perfectly for your situation. From our conversation, it sounds like you're ready to move forward - is that right?"

## üéØ **Key Variables That Make This Work**

The system prompt uses these variables to adapt Jack's responses:

### **For New Customers:**
- `conversation_context`: "New conversation - no previous history"
- `lead_status`: "New Inquiry"
- `previous_summary`: "First conversation"

### **For SMS Continuations:**
- `conversation_context`: "Customer interested in Honda Civic, budget $400/month, good credit score"
- `lead_status`: "Returning Customer"
- `previous_summary`: "Customer has been pre-qualified, discussing specific vehicles"

3. **Professional approach** for new customers
4. **Seamless experience** for existing customers

### **The Magic:**

## üìã **Implementation Checklist**

‚úÖ **Use neutral first message** - Works for both scenarios
‚úÖ **System prompt references all variables** - Handles context adaptation
‚úÖ **Jack immediately acknowledges context** - References previous conversations
‚úÖ **Professional for new customers** - Doesn't assume prior contact
‚úÖ **Seamless for existing customers** - Continues naturally from SMS

**Result:** Jack sounds intelligent and context-aware without making assumptions in the first message!
