-- FIND AND ATTACH TO NEW ORGANIZATION SCRIPT
-- This script will find your actual organization ID in the NEW database
-- and properly attach the lead and phone number to it

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: FIND YOUR ACTUAL ORGANIZATION ID
-- =====================================================

-- First, let's see what organization was created for your user
SELECT
    'Your Organization Details:' as info,
    u.id as user_id,
    u.email,
    u.organization_id,
    o.id as org_id,
    o.name as org_name,
    o.slug
FROM public.user_profiles u
LEFT JOIN public.organizations o ON u.organization_id = o.id
WHERE u.email = 'divhit@gmail.com'
   OR u.id = '57bba8b1-40f1-4725-870f-42dd383c02c9';

-- Also check organization_memberships table
SELECT
    'Organization Memberships:' as info,
    om.user_id,
    om.organization_id,
    om.role,
    om.is_active,

FROM public.organization_memberships om
LEFT JOIN public.organizations o ON om.organization_id = o.id
WHERE om.user_id = '57bba8b1-40f1-4725-870f-42dd383c02c9';

-- Show all organizations in the database
SELECT
    'All Organizations:' as info,
    id,
    name,
    slug,
    created_at
FROM public.organizations
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: AFTER YOU IDENTIFY THE CORRECT ORG ID
-- REPLACE 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ORG_ID_HERE' WITH THE REAL ONE
-- =====================================================

-- Uncomment and modify the section below once you know the org ID:
