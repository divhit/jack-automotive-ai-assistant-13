- **Organization phone numbers** for dedicated routing
- **Analytics tables** for call sessions and metrics
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for additional protection

### External Integrations

```

## 🔒 Security Model

### Organization Isolation
Every database operation includes `organization_id` filtering:
```sql
SELECT * FROM leads WHERE organization_id = $1 AND phone_number = $2
```

### Authentication Flow
1. **User registers** → Creates/joins organization
2. **JWT token issued** → Contains organizationId
3. **Every API call** → Validates token + organization access
4. **Database queries** → Automatically scoped by organization

### Cross-Organization Conflict Handling
When same phone number exists in multiple organizations:
- **System detects ambiguity** and requires explicit organizationId
- **Prevents data leakage** by returning null instead of guessing
- **Logs security warnings** for audit trail

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. **Environment setup** → Supabase, Twilio, ElevenLabs accounts
2. **Database migration** → Run schema files
3. **Start services** → Backend (port 3001) + Frontend (port 3000)
4. **Webhook tunneling** → ngrok for local webhook testing
5. **Test end-to-end** → SMS → AI response → UI update

### Production Deployment
1. **Render.com hosting** → Automatic deploys from Git
2. **Environment variables** → All secrets configured
3. **Webhook configuration** → Production URLs in Twilio/ElevenLabs
4. **Health monitoring** → Status endpoints and error tracking

## 📱 User Experience

### For Dealership Staff
1. **Login to dashboard** → See organization-specific leads
2. **Monitor conversations** → Real-time SMS/call updates
3. **Manual intervention** → Send SMS, make calls when needed
4. **Lead management** → Update status, assign agents, view analytics

### For Customers
1. **Natural conversations** → SMS or voice, AI responds intelligently  
2. **Context preservation** → Switch channels without repeating information
3. **Personalized experience** → AI knows their name, preferences, history
4. **Consistent branding** → Each dealership maintains their identity

## 🎯 Business Value

3. **SMS not routing** → Verify phone number in organization_phone_numbers table
4. **Real-time updates missing** → Check SSE connection and leadId mapping
5. **Cross-org data leakage** → Audit database queries for missing organization_id filters

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;"

# View active connections
grep "SSE\|WebSocket\|organization" server.log

# Test webhook endpoints
curl -X POST localhost:3001/api/webhooks/elevenlabs/conversation-initiation
```
